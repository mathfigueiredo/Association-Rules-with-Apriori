 All the instructions are inside [the Notebook](https://github.com/mathfigueiredo/Association-Rules-with-Apriori/blob/main/Association%20rules.ipynb) in this repository :)

The result of this project is the following table:
- IF a customer buys A, THEN there is a higher chance of also buying B.
- Pay attention to the lift column It tells us how higher is the chance of buying A AND B.
